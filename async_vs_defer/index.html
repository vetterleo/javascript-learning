    <!-- The browser stop the parsing at that point of time and then sees the script tag and then 
        fetches the script from the network and gets into the browser and then runs it
        While the script is fetched from the network and executed on the browser the parsing of the html
        is paused and resumed after. So the javascript is blocking the rendering of the html -->
    <script src="main.js"></script>

    <!-- Meanwhile the html parsing is going on the script is fetched from the network in parallel.
        As soon as the script is fetched and available on the browser the html parsing stops and the 
        script is executed. After the script is executed the html parsing resumes -->
    <script async src="main.js"></script>

    <!-- With defer tag the html parsing goes on and the script is fetched in parallel
        And the html parsing continues and the script is only executed when the html parsing is fully completed
         -->
    <script defer src="main.js"></script>
